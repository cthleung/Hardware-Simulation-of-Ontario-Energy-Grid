## Introduction
This project leverages IoT sensors and embedded electronics to simulate the Ontario energy grid. It integrates machine learning models to predict electricity demand according to various factors such as date, time, and weather conditions. Furthermore, a visualization system has been developed to monitor electricity demand and supply in real-time.

## Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project include:

- C++
- Arduino
- PID control
- Python
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter

## Project Description
- Developed Scikit-learn models (time series forecasting, nonlinear multiple regression) to predict electricity demand according to date, time, and weather conditions.
- Created hardware interfaces with other modules (operator, communications, power plants) via WiFi.
- Developed a visualization system for simulated electricity demand and supply in real-time using Tkinter and Matplotlib.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries (Tkinter, Matplotlib, serial, threading) installed.
3. Make sure you have a correct hardware setup to read values from a serial device.
4. Run the python script to execute the code and view the real-time data visualization.
